Instructions to get "DigitalInstrumentWavAppender.rb" working:
This will take notes pressed and append them into a file called append.wav
In order to get it to work you have to copy the wavefile gem to the shoes directory with this command: 
"cd ~ && cp -r .gem/ruby/gems/wavefile-0.7.0/ .shoes/walkabout/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/"
Then you can run the shoes application and press open application. Select DigitalInstrumentWavAppender.rb

That should get you running
